```

Then, run the development server:

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js app directory with pages and layout
- `public/` - Static assets
- `components/` - Reusable React components (if added)

## Customization

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically
